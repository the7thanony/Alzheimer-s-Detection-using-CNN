# Alzheimer-s-Detection-using-CNN
This project uses deep learning to detect and classify Alzheimer's disease from MRI scans. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was built using TensorFlow and Keras. Preprocessing techniques and data augmentation were applied to improve model accuracy. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, and recall, with training done on Google Colab.
