Alzheimer's Disease Detection using Deep Learning
This project focuses on detecting and classifying Alzheimer's disease from MRI scan images using deep learning techniques. The model predicts different stages of Alzheimer's disease (Mild, Moderate, and Severe) to assist in early diagnosis and treatment.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Applied image preprocessing techniques like resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to enhance model generalization and reduce overfitting.
Deep Learning Model: Built and fine-tuned a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for image classification. The architecture was designed to capture intricate patterns in MRI images, enabling effective prediction of Alzheimer's stages.
Evaluation Metrics: Used performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model effectiveness. Achieved high accuracy on the test set, demonstrating the modelâ€™s ability to make reliable predictions.
Tools and Environment: Utilized Google Colab for GPU-accelerated training and hyperparameter tuning, enabling faster experimentation and model optimization.
Technologies Used:
Python, TensorFlow, Keras
OpenCV for image processing
Google Colab for training and experimentation
Scikit-learn for evaluation metrics
